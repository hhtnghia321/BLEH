# ðŸ¤– BLEH (bleh bleh) â€” Bot for Learning Everything Haphazardly

Welcome to **BLEH** (bleh bleh), the chatbot you never knew you needed â€” and maybe still donâ€™t.  
BLEH lives in your Notion, answers your questions (sometimes even accurately), and syncs chaos with knowledge like a caffeinated intern.

## ðŸ§  What is BLEH?

BLEH is a chatbot integrated with a Language Model API (like OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT) and a Notion-based knowledge management system.

It helps you:

- Ask questions directly from Web App
- Get somewhat reasonable answers
- (Optionally) write those answers back into Notion so you can forget them later
- Organize and manage your chat into a knowledge-base

## âœ¨ Features

- ðŸ’¬ Chat via a custom web app

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hhtnghia321/BLEH.git
   cd bleh
   ```
